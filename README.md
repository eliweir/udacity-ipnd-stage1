# Udacity IPND Stage 1

Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree Stage 1 project, using HTML and CSS to render notes for the first 3 lessons.


**Requirements**

1. Use of Syntax: HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass HTML validation and CSS validation tests.

2. Use of Logical HTML Structure: Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a ``<div>`` or ``<span>``). Additionally, all tags should be used for their semantic purpose (ex: don't use a ``<p>``; tag to make a headline).

3. Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling (via linked CSS file): There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. Similar HTML elements should have the same class name.

4. Use of Tags: Page uses tags correctly. ``<p>`` for paragraphs. ``<h1>`` for main heading, etc.

5. Content Display: Page displays at least 1 image and some text.


**Note**

I used new HTML5/CSS3 semantic elements such as ``<section>``, `<nav>`, ``<address>``, but in a way that should degrade gracefully in unsupported browsers.
